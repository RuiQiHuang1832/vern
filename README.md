# Reviews Hub – Media Review Concept App

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was primarily a **testbed** for learning new technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, CSS Modules, etc.) and experimenting with frontend concepts. It is **not a production-ready reviews platform**, but rather a proof-of-concept to practice building out UI, state management, and feature workflows.

A media review site prototype where users can create accounts, explore media, and draft playlists/reviews.  
More of a **concept app** than a polished product, but it served as an important first step in building my frontend skillset.

The codebase demonstrates early frontend skills but is not actively maintained.

## ❓ FAQ

**Why is it called “vern”?**  
The name “vern” was chosen simply as a creative identifier. It was inspired by a character reference from a television show and selected because it felt distinctive, simple, and memorable.
