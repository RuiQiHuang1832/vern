## Server Information

This application is hosted on [Render.com](https://render.com), a cloud platform for deploying and scaling web applications. Please be aware of the following information regarding server spin-up time and content:

- **Server Spin-up Time**: The application is hosted on a free version of Render.com, which has a spin-up time of approximately 15 minutes. As a result, the initial loading of the website may take some time. Subsequent visits will have faster loading times.

- **Content Placeholder**: The text and images you currently see on the website are placeholders used for illustrative purposes. They do not reflect the final content of the application and are included solely to provide an example structure.

I appreciate your patience during the spin-up time and encourage you to explore the website's functionality once it has fully loaded. For any inquiries or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for understanding!

The synergy of these technologies empowers the application to deliver a seamless user experience while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
