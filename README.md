## Technology Stack

This project leverages a comprehensive technology stack to deliver a robust and efficient web application:

### Front-End

- **Next.js (with Server-Side Rendering)**: Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, enhancing performance and search engine optimization (SEO).
- **TypeScript (TS)**: TypeScript ensures type safety and enhances code readability, making development more efficient.
- **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules allow for modular and scoped styling, reducing potential naming conflicts.
- **Bootstrap 5 (BS5)**: Bootstrap streamlines responsive and visually appealing UI design with its extensive component library.
- **React**: The core library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Lodash**: Lodash simplifies complex operations and provides utility functions for enhanced code maintainability.
- **React Query**: React Query facilitates data fetching and caching, optimizing application performance.
- **classNames Library**: classNames simplifies the management of dynamic CSS class names.
- **Custom Components**: Custom components ensure a tailored and consistent user experience.
- **Helper Functions**: Helper functions encapsulate reusable logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks encapsulate logic for better code organization and reuse.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Adhering to the principle of separation of concerns enhances code maintainability by isolating distinct functionalities.

The synergy of these technologies empowers the application to deliver a seamless user experience while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
